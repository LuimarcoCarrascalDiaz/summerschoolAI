Zero-shot Prompting is a technique where an AI model is given a task or question without any specific examples or prior training for that particular task. The model is expected to generate a relevant response based solely on its pre-existing knowledge and understanding of language.

Few-shot Prompting involves providing the AI model with a small number of examples or demonstrations of the desired task before asking it to perform a similar task. This approach helps guide the model's understanding and improves its ability to generate appropriate responses for the given context.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting is a method that encourages the AI model to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps. By prompting the model to show its reasoning process, it can often produce more accurate and logical answers, especially for tasks that require multiple steps or complex reasoning.

Self-Consistency is an approach where multiple responses are generated for the same prompt, and the most consistent or common answer among them is selected as the final output. This technique helps improve the reliability and accuracy of the model's responses by leveraging the wisdom of multiple attempts.

Generate Knowledge Prompting involves asking the AI model to generate relevant background information or facts before answering a specific question. This approach helps the model access and utilize its knowledge base more effectively, leading to more informed and comprehensive responses.

Prompt Chaining is a technique where multiple prompts are used in sequence, with each prompt building upon the output of the previous one. This method allows for more complex and multi-step tasks to be broken down into manageable segments, improving the overall quality and coherence of the final output.

Tree of Thoughts is an approach that extends the Chain-of-Thought method by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. It creates a tree-like structure of potential thought processes, allowing the model to consider various possibilities and select the most promising path to arrive at a solution.

Retrieval Augmented Generation combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval systems. This technique allows the model to access and incorporate relevant information from external sources, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and up-to-date responses.

Directional Stimulus Prompting is a method that guides the AI model's response in a specific direction or towards a particular type of output. By providing clear instructions or constraints within the prompt, this technique helps shape the model's generation process to align with the desired outcome.

ReAct Prompting integrates reasoning and acting steps into the prompting process. This approach encourages the model to alternate between generating thoughts or reasoning steps and taking actions based on those thoughts, allowing for more dynamic and interactive problem-solving.

Multimodal CoT Prompting extends the Chain-of-Thought approach to include multiple types of input, such as text, images, or audio. This technique enables the model to process and reason about information from various modalities, leading to more comprehensive and context-aware responses in tasks that involve multiple types of data.
