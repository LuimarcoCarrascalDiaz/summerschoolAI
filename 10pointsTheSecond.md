Code Assistant: Gemini Code Assistant
IDE: Google Colab

Rationale for choice:
1. Integration: Gemini is directly integrated with Google Colab, providing a seamless experience.
2. AI capabilities: Powered by Google's advanced language models, offering strong code generation and assistance.
3. Collaboration: Colab's collaborative features complement Gemini's abilities for team projects.
4. Free access: Both Colab and basic Gemini features are available for free, making it accessible.
5. Cloud-based: No need for local installation, can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.
6. Jupyter Notebook format: Ideal for data science and machine learning projects, combining code and documentation.

I actually like this assistant cause it is fully integrated with colab, it actually has an auto complete function which is very time saving and the generation is very fast, so I feel this
could save a lot of time in my job, and the color palette is good looking as well, I like that for example if you use tab key it will automatically completa the snippet I am
trying to write eventhough sometimes it does not predict my snippet of code accurately it is very fair, and if you just want to use a fragment of the sentence you can type ctrl + left arrow
to complete word by word. Overall it is a nice tool.
